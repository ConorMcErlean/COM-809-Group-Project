# COM-809-Group-Project

If git is new you can look at the tutorials here for more information: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7q2eaUkorLZExfd7qko9sZC however this is not necessary and is beyond what you will need to use. Feel free to ask Conor if you have any questions or concerns!

Repository of files for COM809 group project.
Files in this repository may have been edited or added by any of the members of the group.

The purpose of this repository is to build a command line program to act as a ordering system in a cafe or restaurant.
The program should accept orders fom a till operator, pass those orders to the kitchen operators, and allow management to control or adjust pricing.



Known Bugs

If i directly go to apply a discount before printing the bill as the till operator then the manager discount does not apply.
if the bill is first printed in the till log in then logged out and into the manager log in then the discount applies but does not show the discount just the discounted price.
when added new items to addItem in manager it only adds the first name.
