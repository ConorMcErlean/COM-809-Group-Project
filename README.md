# COM-809-Group-Project

If git is new you can look at the tutorials here for more information: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7q2eaUkorLZExfd7qko9sZC however this is not necessary and is beyond what you will need to use. Feel free to ask Conor if you have any questions or concerns!

# Known Bugs


Discount only applies when till has printed the bill.[Testing Fix]

Discount not shown, only discounted price. [Testing Fix]

Printing to a file not working [Testing Fix]

Adding new Items only adds first word in name [Testing fix].

Adding new items now print a list of all the items and their details but says the new item is out of stock...

when choosing the view current orders option, if you enter the table number wrong ie. entering 4 insteadd of 1 it throws up the index out of bounds error
