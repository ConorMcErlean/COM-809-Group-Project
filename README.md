# COM-809-Group-Project

If git is new you can look at the tutorials here for more information: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7q2eaUkorLZExfd7qko9sZC however this is not necessary and is beyond what you will need to use. Feel free to ask Conor if you have any questions or concerns!

Any addditional files or documents that dont make sense on the Git, just throw them there!

Repository of files for COM809 group project.
Files in this repository may have been edited or added by any of the members of the group.

The purpose of this repository is to build a command line program to act as a ordering system in a cafe or restaurant.
The program should accept orders fom a till operator, pass those orders to the kitchen operators, and allow management to control or adjust pricing.



# Known Bugs


Discount only applies when till has printed the bill.[Testing Fix]

Discount not shown, only discounted price. [Testing Fix]

Printing to a file not working [Testing Fix]

Adding new Items only adds first word in name [Testing fix].

Adding new items now print a list of all the items and their details but says the new item is out of stock...
[Testing Fix]

when choosing options to do with orders, if you enter the table number wrong ie. entering 4 insteadd of 1 it throws up the index out of bounds error
[Testing fix]

if you type a character eg. k when instead of entering a number it goes into an invaild loop that you have to stop and restart the program to do anything else


When the manager selects view out of stock it makes the user input a number to mark an item out of stock instead of viewing them.

When the final bill is printed do we want discount to appear on the bill too? if not it just looks like our math sucks.
